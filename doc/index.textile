title: Apache Buildr
---

Apache Buildr is a build system for Java-based applications, including support for Scala, Groovy and a growing number of JVM languages and tools.  We wanted something that's simple and intuitive to use, so we only need to tell it what to do, and it takes care of the rest.  But also something we can easily extend for those one-off tasks, with a language that's a joy to use.  And of course, we wanted it to be fast, reliable and have outstanding dependency management.


h2(#why).  Why Buildr Rocks

"Daniel Spiewak":http://www.codecommit.com/blog:

bq. If you think about it, the question isn’t “Why use Buildr?”, it’s really “Why use anything else?” The advantages afforded by Buildr are so substantial, I really can’t see myself going with any other tool, at least not when I have a choice.

"Tristan Juricek":http://tristanhunt.com/:

bq. That’s still the strongest sell: it builds everything I need, and as I’ve needed more, I just got things working without a lot of fuss.

"Matthieu Riou":http://offthelip.org/:

bq. We used to rely on Ant, with a fairly extensive set of scripts. It worked but was expensive to maintain. The biggest mistake afterward was to migrate to Maven2. I could write pages of rants explaining all the problems we ran into and we still ended up with thousands of lines of XML.

"Martin Grotzke":http://www.javakaffee.de/blog/:

bq. The positive side effect for me as a java user is that I learn a little ruby, and that’s easy but lots of fun… :-)

"Ijonas Kisselbach":http://twitter.com/ijonas/statuses/4134103928:

bq. I've cleaned up & migrated the Vamosa build process from 768 lines of Ant build.xml to 28 lines of Buildr.

h2(#what).  What You Get

* A simple way to specify projects, and build large projects out of smaller sub-projects.
* Pre-canned tasks that require the least amount of configuration, keeping the build script DRY and simple.
* Compiling, copying and filtering resources, JUnit/TestNG test cases, APT source code generation, Javadoc and more.
* A dependency mechanism that only builds what has changed since the last release.
* A drop-in replacement for Maven 2.0, Buildr uses the same file layout, artifact specifications, local and remote repositories.
* All your Ant tasks are belong to us! Anything you can do with Ant, you can do with Buildr.
* No overhead for building "plugins" or configuration. Just write new tasks or functions.
* Buildr is Ruby all the way down.  No one-off task is too demanding when you write code using variables, functions and objects.
* Simple way to upgrade to new versions.
* Did we mention fast?

So let's get started.  You can "read the documentation online":quick_start.html, or "download the PDF":buildr.pdf.


h2(#news).  What's New

* Fixed:  BUILDR-702 - Retain Unix permission flags when merging
          zip files into another zip or tar archive. Submitted by Pepijn Van Eeckhoudt.
* Change: Upgrade jacoco to 0.7.2 to support Java 8. Submitted by neher.
* Change: Update checkstyle addon to use Checkstyle 6.0.
* Added:  Update checkstyle addon to support downloading checkstyle checks as an artifact.
* Added:  Update checkstyle addon to supply checkstyle.config.dir property.
* Added:  Update pmd addon to support downloading rule files as an artifact.
* Change: Update pmd addon to use pmd version 5.1.3.
* Change: Update rjb to version 1.5.1.
* Change: Update the gwt addon to add the validation dependencies required for GWT
          compiles without requiring that the user specify the dependency.
* Added:  Updated the gwt addon to support the GWT 2.7.0 release.
* Change: Update ipr.add_gwt_configuration method to support GWT 2.7 configuration
          parameters and IDEA 14 parameters.
* Change: Enhance ipr.add_glassfish_configuration to support the ability to
          define the version of GlassFish in uses. Change the default to 4.1.0
          as that is the latest supported variant.
* Fixed:  Change the name of the GlassFish install in ipr.add_glassfish_configuration
          to use the same convention that IDEA uses by default. i.e. Name the
          installation "GlassFish 4.1.0" rather than "Glassfish 4.1.0".
* Change: Change the default version of the jdk in IDEA project files to 1.7.
* Change: Change the default version of the IDEA project files created to the
          current release version 13. To revert to the older versions specify
          ipr.version = '12' in your buildfile.
* Added:  Enhance the IdeaFile class to easily support mixing in of custom
          components from either the filesystem or from an artifact.
